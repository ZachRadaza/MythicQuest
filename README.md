# Mythic Quest Website

This project is to practice my Web Application skills alongside being a tool I can work on in my CSC 193A(Web Programming) class. Through this site, I hope to strengthen my fundementals of Web Programming.

This website is a mock website, being what potentially would be a website the "Mythic Quest", a MMORPG game in the show "Mythic Quest", would possibly look like. I am drawing strong inspiration from the World of Warcraft website, as the show immitates it.
